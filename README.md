# TV Show Buddy

Welcome to the **TV Show Buddy** project! 🎬📺✨ This repository is part of a weekly series of tutorials and guides designed to help you build an API from scratch using Java and Spring Boot. The main goal is to create an API for managing and recommending TV show episodes.

## What Are We Building? 🎥📖🎉

We will develop an API that lets users manage their favorite TV shows and receive random episode recommendations. Perfect for those moments when you just want to relax and watch an episode without wasting time deciding what to watch!

### Features

The initial features of the API will include:

- **List all registered TV shows**
- **Add a new show to the catalog**
- **Retrieve episodes of a specific show**
- **Remove a show from the catalog**

## Project Objective 🎯💻📚

This project is a great learning opportunity for beginner developers. By following these tutorials, you'll gain a solid foundation in backend development, including:

- Setting up your development environment (JDK, Maven, Postman, and IDE)
- Creating a Spring Boot project
- Structuring your application
- Configuring the database
- Implementing CRUD endpoints
- Applying best practices in API development
- Writing tests

## How to Run the Application 🚀🛠️🖥️

You have two options to run the application:

### Option 1 - Using Maven

You can run the application with the following command:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Ensure that Maven is properly installed and configured in your environment.

### Option 2 - Using IntelliJ IDEA

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Import the project as a Maven project.
3. Navigate to the main class (usually found in `src/main/java`).
4. Right-click the main class and select **Run 'TvShowBuddyApplication'**.

The application should now start and run locally.

## Postman Collection 📂🧪📬

A Postman collection is available to facilitate API testing. You can find it in the following directory:

```
src/main/resources/postman
```

Import the collection into Postman to test the available endpoints easily.
