# TV Show Buddy

Welcome to the **TV Show Buddy** project! This repository is part of a weekly series of tutorials and guides designed to help you build an API from scratch using Java and Spring Boot. The main goal is to create an API for managing and recommending TV show episodes.

## What Are We Building?
We will develop an API that lets users manage their favorite TV shows and receive random episode recommendations. Perfect for those moments when you just want to relax and watch an episode without wasting time deciding what to watch!

### Features
The initial features of the API will include:

- **List all registered TV shows**
- **Add a new show to the catalog**
- **Retrieve episodes of a specific show**
- **Remove a show from the catalog**
